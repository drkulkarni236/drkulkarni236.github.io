										<h2>Hate Speech Detection in Hinglish and korean</h2>

								<h2>Overwiew</h2>

								<p>In this project, we aimed to address hate speech detection in multiple languages, specifically Hinglish (culturally similar to English) and Korean  (linguistically different and culturally distinct). Our primary objective was to assess the effectiveness of diverse transformer-based language models for these languages, such as exploring whether language-agnostic frameworks like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01852" target="_blank">LaBSE</a> outperformed the more widely-used <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805" target="_blank">mBERT</a> model. A key part of our project involved conducting thorough error analysis to gain insights into the challenges specific to hate speech detection in these languages. We explored the nuances of hate expression, recognizing that different languages manifest hate in unique ways.</p>

								<h2>Approach</h2>

								<ul>
									<li><strong>Language Selection:</strong> The selection of languages was based on their linguistic and cultural disparities. Hindi/Hinglish, sharing linguistic roots with English, exhibits cultural similarities in the directness of hate speech expression and the use of explicit language. Conversely, Korean, both linguistically and culturally distinct, emphasizes formality and a more nuanced expression of hate speech. Furthermore, it's worth noting that our team included fluent speakers of both these languages.</li>
									<li><strong>Model Choice/Hypothesis:</strong>The choice of models and hypothesis guiding this research was centered on comparing the suitability of various transformer-based language models for two linguistically distinct languages. We hypothesized that the cultural and linguistic nuances, particularly in Korean hate speech, might require different model architectures for optimal performance in Hindi and Korean, with a specific interest in assessing the potential benefits of employing a language-agnostic framework in Korean.</li>
									<li><strong>Technological Frameworks:</strong> The computational infrastructure for this study was facilitated by Google Colab, and the deep learning frameworks TensorFlow and Keras were employed for tasks including input tokenization, construction and optimization of deep learning models, and classification.</li>
									<li><strong>Metric Considerations/Error Analysis:</strong> We utilized standard classification metrics, prioritizing recall, given its relevance in real-world scenarios to minimize false negatives. We conducted extensive error analysis, particularly focusing on false negatives generated by the models, to gain qualitative insights into accurately identified hate speech and model limitations in the cultural contexts of Hinglish and Korean.</li>
									<li><strong>Alternative Approaches:</strong> Beyond traditional classification, we investigated alternative methods such as zero-shot learning, transfer learning, and translation to English to enhance the models' ability to detect hate speech.</li>
								</ul> <br>


								<h2>Conclusions</h2>

								<p>This project addresses the critical issue of hate speech detection in linguistically diverse languages such as Hinglish and Korean. Our exploration of transformer-based models, including mBERT and LaBSE, emphasizes the central role of recall in effectively identifying hate speech, transcending language barriers. Additionally, our cultural insights underscore the significance of considering unique nuances in hate expression across linguistic and cultural contexts.</p>								


								<h2>Future Work</h2>

								<p>Future work could involve investigating character-based models, like ByT5, to develop an approach less dependent on formal vocabulary in training data. Further collaboration and data gathering efforts should be pursued to enhance hate speech detection across languages and regions. This project lays the groundwork for ongoing research aimed at creating a safer and more respectful digital environment for users worldwide.</p>
